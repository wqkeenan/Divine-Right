Divine Right





Tech Tree

In the Vanilla version of Unciv, Agriculture forms the root of all technology. Fair enough. However, in a high fantasy setting, not all races develop in a sun lit world. Therefore, agriculture needed to be an optional technology. As such, crafting or tool-making has been made the root technology.
