# Divine Right

## What is Divine Right?

Divine Right is an high fantasy [UnCiv](https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/) mod, loosely based on the classic board game [Divine Right](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/23/divine-right). 

### Why base an UnCiv mod on some long out-of-print board game few people have ever heard of?

Divine Right, the board game, was a clash of kingdoms, human and non-human, vying for control of the continent of Minaria. Combat, siege, diplomancy, and magic were all part of the game. What set it appart from other games was the rich mythology and history. The map featured the ruins and remnains of ancient civilizations. 

## Tech Tree

In the Vanilla version of Unciv, Agriculture forms the root of all technology. Fair enough. However, in a high fantasy setting, not all races develop in a sun lit world. Therefore, agriculture needed to be an optional technology. As such, crafting or tool-making has been made the root technology. 


## History

The 
humans, elves, goblins, dwarves and trolls empire of the Lloroi Empire ruled Minaria for a thousand years.
